Slepians.jl is a package that solves the concentration problem of Slepian,
Landau and Pollak, numerically. Loosely speaking, we find a function that is
both finite in extent, and has a Fourier transform which lies in a certain
domain. In a single dimension, with discrete sampling, the discrete prolate 
spheroidal sequences solve this optimization problem. 


# Installation

Slepians.jl is unregistered and relies on unregistered packages.  To avoid
difficulties in which Julia does not know the relevant URLS, I have created a
registry bbkt-reg.jl which will tell your installation where to find this
package and its dependencies. Begin with adding the registry using 

```
pkg> registry add https://github.com/lootie/bbkt-reg.jl
```

then one can simply add the Slepians.jl package as

```
pkg> add Slepians
```

# Examples

The jupyter notebooks in the `Examples/` directory illustrate the functionality
of this package.
